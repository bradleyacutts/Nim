			After sending the challenge, the client code should wait for a reply. (This time you are waiting on a person instead
			of a machine. Allow sufficient time to the response.) The server’s user has the option to accept or refuse the
			challenge. The choice will be reflected in a datagram that contains either the string “YES” or the string “NO”. If the
			response is “NO”, your code should allow your user to challenge some other host or quit the program.

			However, if the response is “YES”, send another UDP datagram containing the string “GREAT!”. Once this
			datagram has been sent, the negotiation phase is complete and your client code should begin to play the game.
			If no response is received from the other user within the time allotted (or the response is something other than
			“YES” or “NO”), your client code should assume the answer is “NO”; and allow your local user to either challenge
			someone else or exit.
